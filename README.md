Developed as part of a course project, the application connects to an HC-05 Bluetooth adapter. The app sends different characters which are deciphered by the receiving Arduino to execute different commands.

The project also includes a facial recognition door lock system. Faces are captured through a camera and stored in Firebase (in Base64 format). The camera takes a photo, and the comparison is done through an API (Face++). It sends a confidence percentage (%) as the result, which is used to determine if the person is in the database or not, as part of the door lock system.
